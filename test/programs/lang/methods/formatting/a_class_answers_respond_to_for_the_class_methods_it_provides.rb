# Ruby decides visibility from the SHAPE of the call, not from the value the

# receiver, for the literal `self` keyword, or for `send` (all FCALL); every
# other explicit receiver is checked.
#
# zr enforced that only where the receiver's class was known at compile time.
# A dynamic call skipped it entirely, so `1.puts("x")` printed, `"ab".initialize`
# answered nil, and a private method reached through a local that merely HELD
# self went through.
