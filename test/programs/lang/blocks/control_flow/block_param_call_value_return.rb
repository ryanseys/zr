# An &block-param method called with a literal block returns the
# value of blk.call, typed by the block body's return type rather than
# as an Integer. Different literal blocks at the same method can give
# values of different types.

# string-returning block: the carried pointer prints as a string,
# not a raw address.

# int-returning block at the SAME method: per-call-site typing, no
# signature change.
puts applies { |x| x.length }

# block body that does not depend on the param's type works for
# instance methods too (value-return typing is receiver-agnostic).

# instance &block method whose block body depends on the yielded arg's
# type: the block param is typed from blk.call's arg (string here), so
# string methods resolve.
