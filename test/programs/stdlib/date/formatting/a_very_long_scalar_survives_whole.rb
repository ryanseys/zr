# The cycle this program builds on purpose, and the census it leaves
# behind. A cycle alive at exit is not a defect: it is a ring the
# program never broke, so the census below is recorded as an
# observation rather than gated on.
#
# Three self-referential documents: a sequence that aliases itself, a mapping that aliases itself, and the `a` / `b` pair where `c: *a` closes the ring.
# At exit: cycle leak: 4 objects (Hash x3, Array x1)
# Every hostile shape the YAML loader has to survive, as ANSWERS rather
# than as a promise. The point of the file is that none of these ends the
# process: each row is either a value or a Ruby exception, and the golden
# pins which.
#
# Written when the loader was reworked to read the anchor id and the tag
# that the parser's events always carried, and it found real defects rather
# than confirming a design -- see `yaml_parser_stress.rb` for the generated
# half.
#
# ONE GROUP IS NOT HERE: the documents the two yaml engines disagree
# about the legality of, which is a decided divergence recorded in
# `tests/yaml_backend_accepts_a_different_dialect.rb`.
